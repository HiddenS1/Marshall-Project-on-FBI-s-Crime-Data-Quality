In 2021, the FBI retired its nearly century-old national crime data collection program, the Summary Reporting System used by the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program. The agency switched to a new system, the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS), which gathers more specific information on each incident.

Nearly 40% of law enforcement agencies around the country did not submit any data to the new system in 2021, leaving a huge gap in national crime statistics. 

To address this data gap, the FBI employed its own methodology to estimate crime data. Nevertheless, there are doubts about the reliability of these estimations, primarily due to the suboptimal reporting situation of agencies.
