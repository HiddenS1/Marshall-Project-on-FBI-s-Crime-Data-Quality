# Marshall Project on FBI's Crime Data Quality

In 2021, the FBI retired its nearly century-old national crime data collection program, the Summary Reporting System used by the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program. The agency switched to a new system, the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS), which gathers more specific information on each incident.

Nearly 40% of law enforcement agencies around the country did not submit any data to the new system in 2021, leaving a huge gap in national crime statistics. 

To address this data gap, the FBI employed its own methodology to estimate crime data. Nevertheless, there are doubts about the reliability of these estimations, primarily due to the suboptimal reporting situation of agencies.

We cooperated with Marshall Project to investigate the new system and its crime data estimation. 

## **What we did as data reporters:**

- [Interviewed](https://github.com/HiddenS1/Marshall-Project-on-FBI-s-Crime-Data-Quality/tree/main/Interviews) data analysts and police officers about FBI’s estimation methodology, data quality issues and its social impact. 
- Assisted investigative journalists in analyzing the impact of FBI’s crime data migration to utilize Python to [wrangle FBI crime data](https://github.com/HiddenS1/Marshall-Project-on-FBI-s-Crime-Data-Quality/tree/main/Notebooks), [analyze for bias](https://github.com/HiddenS1/Marshall-Project-on-FBI-s-Crime-Data-Quality/tree/main/Notebooks), [create data visualization](https://github.com/HiddenS1/Marshall-Project-on-FBI-s-Crime-Data-Quality/tree/main/Visualizations), and write news articles. 
- Outperformed FBI's crime data estimate by over 15% using [a fitted ARIMA model](https://github.com/HiddenS1/Marshall-Project-on-FBI-s-Crime-Data-Quality/tree/main/Independent%20Estimation) on NY historical crime data. 
- Discussed future plans for in-depth analysis.
